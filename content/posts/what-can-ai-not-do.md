# What can AI not do?
In this blog post I will try to define what AI can do, which helps us as developers and professionals, and perhaps what
are some limitations on the LLMs that currently exist.

I have been using a few different _AI Editors_ and I have some thoughts on it. Mainly I will list what are, in my
opinion, the best editors but also will talk about the final verdict.

So far I have used the following tools:
1. Cursor
2. Windsurf
3. GitHub Copilot in Android Studio
4. Junie in IntelliJ IDEA
